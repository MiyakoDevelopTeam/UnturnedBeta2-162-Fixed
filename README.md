# UnturnedBeta 2-162 Fixed Version
This is a test version found from Rebbit, unfortunately the version above Rebbit wouldn't go in, so I used dnSpy to force remove some methods and content to get the Unturned test version to work *(Not all.)*!

*(I can't find that post anymore, I'll write it here when I find it)*


## ZIPs

v2.0_beta2_ver162 (2014) (Fixed).zip is *fixed*.

v2.0_beta2_ver162 (2014) (Unfixed).zip is a *download from Rebbit*, *I'm not sure I've modified it* as when I finished (July 2023) I kept it on my hard drive unpublished.

## DLLs

Assembly-CSharp.dll is a *repaired version*

Assembly-CSharp-cleaned.dll is the *de-obfuscated version*.

Assembly-CSharp-obf.dll is the *version on the original Rebbit*, i.e. *obfuscated*.

## WARNING

I *removed* the *logic of the exit game method* to keep the game from automatically ending the game, so when you're in the map, you can only close the game via *Alt+F4* or the *Taskmgr*.

The game doesn't seem to have had a logic for saving game data in the first place, and I'm not sure if that's due to my own changes.
